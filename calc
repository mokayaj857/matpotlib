# Function to calculate the accumulated amount and compound interest
def calculate_compound_interest(P, r, n, t):
    # Calculate accumulated amount
    A = P * (1 + r / n) ** (n * t)
    
    # Calculate compound interest
    CI = A - P
    
    # Return both accumulated amount and compound interest
    return A, CI

# Given values
P = 150000  # Principal amount in Ksh
r = 0.043   # Annual interest rate (4.3%)
n = 4       # Compounding quarterly
t = 6       # Time in years

# Calculate the accumulated amount and compound interest
A, CI = calculate_compound_interest(P, r, n, t)

# Display the results
print(f"The total accumulated amount after {t} years is: Ksh {A:.2f}")
print(f"The total compound interest after {t} years is: Ksh {CI:.2f}")
